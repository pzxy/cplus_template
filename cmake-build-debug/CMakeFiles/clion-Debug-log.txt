CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:30 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findhttplib.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "httplib", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "httplib" with any
  of the following names:

    httplibConfig.cmake
    httplib-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "httplib" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "httplib_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "httplib" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
